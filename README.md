# Example of Use of [LaTeX Reference Manager](https://github.com/bringauto/latex-references-manager)

This is a simple example of how to use the LaTeX Reference Manager to manage references in a LaTeX document. The project contains three example LaTeX documents:

1. `virtual_vehicle/virtual_vehicle.tex`
2. `modules/example_module/example_module.tex`
3. `modules/io_module/io_module.tex`

This project can be built by running `make` in each of the project directories, or by running `make` once in the root directory. It generates a PDF file in each project directory and demonstrates how referencing works between the generated files. For further information on how to use the LaTeX Reference Manager, please refer to the documentation in the [LaTeX Reference Manager](https://github.com/bringauto/latex-references-manager) repository.
